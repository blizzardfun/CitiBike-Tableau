# CitiBike-Tableau
Analysis of the New York City CitiBike Program using Tableau
Data was downloaded from https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data
cleaned up and prepared with Jupyter Notebooks. The Notebooks used are available on GitHub. Some small amount of cleanup to stations was done 
using Excel which is not available. Analysis was done on Tableau and made available by embedding the workbooks in the index.html on this repository.
